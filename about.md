I am a 5th year graduate student at Northwestern University. I am supervised by [Tuca Auffinger](https://sites.math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/index.html) and [Reza Gheissari](https://sites.northwestern.edu/gheissari/). My research is partially supported through a NSERC PGSD award. 

### More Information

I primarily work in high dimensional probability. In particular I am interested in behavior of spin glasses (static and dynamic), and applications of probability to high dimensional statistical problems.      

I am on the job market for the academic year of 2026-2027.
