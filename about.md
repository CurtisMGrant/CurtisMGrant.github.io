### More Information

I primarily work in high dimensional probability. In particular I am interested in behavior of spin glasses (static and dynamic), and applications of probability to high dimensional statistical problems.      
Previously I have worked on problems in Geometric Group theory and Geometric topology.   
My preprints are available [here](/research)
