I am a 3rd year graduate student at Northwestern University. I am supervised by [Antonio Auffinger](http://math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/) and [Reza Gheissari](https://sites.northwestern.edu/gheissari/).

### More Information

I am interested in high dimensional probability. Particularly Spin glasses and their dynamics, and Statiscal learning Theory.   
Previously I was interested in Geometric Group theory and Geometric topology.   
My preprints are available [here](/research)
