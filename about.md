I am a 3rd year graduate student at Northwestern University. I am supervised by [Tuca Auffinger](http://math.northwestern.edu/~auffing/) and [Reza Gheissari](https://sites.northwestern.edu/gheissari/).

### More Information

I primarily work in high dimensional probability. In particular I am interested in behavior of spin glasses (static and dynamic), and applications of probability to high dimensional statistical problems.      
Previously I have worked on problems in Geometric Group theory and Geometric topology.   
My preprints are available [here](/research)
